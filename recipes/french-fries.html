    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's nothing better than homemade french fries - they're light, crispy, and full of flavor. Many restaurants use frozen fries, and I think my version is so much better because there's a freshness factor that the frozen fries just can't touch!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes</li>
      <li>oil for frying I use vegetable or peanut oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
      <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
      <li>Pour 3 inches of oil into a large, deep pot. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.</li>
      <li>lace about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
      <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3 of the potatoes back in the pot and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the cooked potatoes on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
