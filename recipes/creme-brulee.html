    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you happen to find yourself looking for a last-minute dessert, crème brûlée is here for you! I used to be super intimidated by this classic French dessert, assuming that anything involving a blow torch and custard would involve all sorts of complicated cooking techniques. But as it turns out, crème brûlée is actually surprisingly simple to make and it's always such a crowd pleaser.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated white sugar, plus extra for topping*</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
